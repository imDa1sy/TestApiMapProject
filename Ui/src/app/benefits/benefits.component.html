    The biogas plants will improve the local ecological situation through processing of widely spread, unused and polluting bio
    waste from agriculture, industry and households.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p translate="Benefits-text2">
    Amongst other goals, the first and main benefit is the additional income for the medium sized farmer. Supposing a rural enterprise
    producing pork, cattle, chicken or processing significant amounts of soya, sorghum, wine, for instance, this company
    can transform the waste from production into electricity and heating.
  </p>
  <p translate="Benefits-text3">
    An example for Moldova is the campaign of medium sized farmers from Kassel region, Germany, in 2011 to 2013, promoting 12
    plants to be set up by the farmers themselves. The outcome has been an increase of the profits per farm by 60 %.
  </p>
  <p translate="Benefits-text4">
    Since this revenue is produced by waste and allows strong benefits for the nature and the country, in general, there is no
    opportunity cost. This means that the additional income widens the national economy of Moldova and allows the by far
    strongest impulses of development by generating huge amounts of additional income sources for the degraded rural area
    of Moldova making Moldova more stable and independent.

        <p translate="Benefits-text12">
            From activities of the Federal German Ministries of Economics and Technology (BMWi), 
            Environment (BMUB) and Development (BMZ), since 2010, 
            a comprehensive cooperation has grown between Moldova and Germany for the transfer of best practices of the decentralized German energy change.
            What has been the paradigm of nuclear power for the German energy change, 
            this is the paradigm of Gazprom in Moldova. 
            Support for this economical and development oriented partnership is received on the communal level of North Hesse (towns of Wolfhagen and Kassel) and on the Federal level of promotional projects of the above mentioned ministries.
            Another important promotion source are members of the board of www.deutsch-moldauisches-Forum.de like former vice-prime minister Rainder Steenblock,
            former Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs Markus Meckel and chairman Dr. Fritz Felgentreu.
            The conception consists of the set-up of communal and regional biogas factories in selected counties of Moldova. 
            They process the widely spread and unused (and even polluting) biowaste from agriculture, industry and households into electricity. This way they internalize the value added from imported electricity generating huge amounts of additional income sources for the degraded rural area of Moldova and make the country more stable and independent from Russian natural gas. Both impacts support the further democratization in the region of Moldova / West Ukraine and Georgia in the sense of stability and peace in Europe.
